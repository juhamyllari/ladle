# Ladle (Log anomaly detector and localizer)
Ladle is an unsupervised method for detecting and localizing anomalies across log types.

## The Ladle article
The Ladle method was published in Automated Software Engineering. You can read the paper [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10515-025-00504-w).

## The state of this repository
The repo now contains sufficient code to run the most basic functions of the Ladle method. More functionality and documentation will be added later. Please see the basic usage notebook to get started.
